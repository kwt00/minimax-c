Minimax C is a C implementation of the minimax algorithm, a recursive backtracking algorithm that is here used to determine the best possible move in tic tac toe.

Using a special algorithm, the computer is able to look through every possible move and map out which position gives it the ultimate edge, returning that position to the user.
